Generating poetry from scientific papers.

Science is a creative enterprise. It's easy to forget - especially when you're spending another weekday drowning in data. It's true, though. Choosing a research topic is a creative act. Developing a model is a creative act. Writing about your findings is a creative act. By using the Poetry Machine, we want to reuse the texts we researchers write to generate new types of meaning from the same texts we interact with every day.
