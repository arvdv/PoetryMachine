# PoetryMachine

Generating poetry from scientific papers.

Science is a creative enterprise. It's easy to forget - especially when you're spending another weekday drowning in data. It's true, though. Choosing a research topic is a creative act. Developing a model is a creative act. Writing about your findings is a creative act. 

The Poetry Machine is an attempt to reintroduce us to our own work. Can we find new meanings in the texts we read and write every day? Can we find joy in what tends to be a utilitarian and septic environment?
