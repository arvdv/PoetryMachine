# PoetryMachine

Generating poetry from scientific papers.

Science is a creative enterprise. It's easy to forget - especially when you're spending another weekday drowning in data. It's true, though. Choosing a research topic is a creative act. Developing a model is a creative act. Writing about your findings is a creative act.

With the poetry machine we want to reintroduce you to the academic literature you read and write every day. Who owns these texts? Who wrote them? What kinds of new meanings can we generate from them?
